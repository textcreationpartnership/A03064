            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Lorious thinges are ſpoken of the grace of graces Faith in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God ſetting himſelfe to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that grace that yeelds vp all the honour vnto him in Chriſt; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the life of our life, and the ſoule of our ſoule. Faith only as the bond of vnion bringeth Chriſt and the ſoule together, and is as an arterie that conueyes the ſpirit from him as the heart; and as the ſinnewes which conuey the ſpirit to mooue to all dutie from him as head, whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh Chriſts liuing in vs, and our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by faith all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Now that which giueth boldneſſe and libertie to faith, is not only Gods aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this office to it in the couenant of grace to come vnto Chriſt, and vnto him in Chriſt to receiue grace, but likewiſe the gracious promiſes whereby the great God hath ingaged himſelfe as a debtour to his poore creature, for all things needfull to life and godlineſſe, vntill that bleſſed time when we ſhall be put into full poſſeſſion of all things wee haue now only in promiſe; when faith ſhall end in fruition, and promiſes in performance.

               </gap>o this word of promiſe, and in the promiſe to Chriſt, in whom and for whom, they are yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> both made
<pb facs="tcp:944:3"/> and performed. And in Chriſt it eyeth God in whom it laſt reſteth, is its proper center and foundation, otherwiſe how ſhould wee weake ſinfull creatures dare to haue any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with God that dwelleth in that light that none can attaine vnto, if hee had not come forth and diſcouered his good pleaſure in Chriſt the ſubſtantiall Word, and in the word inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt for the good of thoſe whom God meant for to make heires of ſaluation. Now theſe promiſes whereon all our preſent comfort and future hope dependeth, lie hid in the Scriptures, as veines of gold and ſiluer in the bowels of the earth, and had need bee laid open, that Gods people may know what vpon good grounds to lay claime vnto. Thoſe therefore that ſearch theſe mynes to bring to light theſe treaſures deſerue well of Gods Church. We commend, (and not without cauſe) the wittie induſtrie of thoſe that from Springs remote bring Riuers to Cities, and by Pipes from thoſe Riuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue water to euery mans houſe for all domeſticall ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: much more ſhould we eſteeme of the religious paines of men that bring theſe waters of life home for euery man his particular vſe, in all the paſſages and turnings of this life. In which regard, I doe not doubt, but the paines of this godly, painfull, and learned man will find good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all children of the promiſes that hope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit them, who hath with great paines, and with good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of ſpirituall vnderſtanding, endeauoured to cleare moſt matters concerning faith; and likewiſe diſcouered the varietie and vſe of the promiſes with teaching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians how to improue their riches in Chriſt heere ſpread before them, how to vſe the ſhield of Faith, and the ſword of the Spirit vpon all occaſions, that ſo they might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be belieuing but skilfull Chriſtians, knowing how to mannage and make the beſt aduantage of their faith, and the word of faith. Which if they could doe, there would another manner of power and beautie ſhine in their liues then doth. Hee is a man that hath formerly deſerued well
<pb facs="tcp:944:3"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in a more ſpeciall manner fitted for a Treatiſe of this nature, as hauing beene put to it, to know by experience what it is <hi>to liue by faith,</hi> hauing in ſight for matters of this life very little whereupon to depend. Thoſe that are driuen to exerciſe their faith, cannot but find God faithfull, as neuer failing thoſe that truſt in him, they ſee more of God then others doe. If it be obiected that others of late time haue digged in the ſame mine, and laboured in the ſame field, and to good purpoſe and ſucceſſe: I anſwer, it is true, the more this age is bound to God that directs the ſpirits of men to ſo vſefull, ſo neceſſarie an argument, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without faith wee haue no communion with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, nothing in this world that can yeeld ſetled comfort to ground the ſoule vpon, ſeeing without it the faireſt carriage is but emptie and dead moralitie, neither finding acceptance with God, nor yeelding comfort to vs in our greateſt extremities, and by it God himſelfe, and Chriſt with all that he hath done, ſuffered, conquered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ours and for our vſe. Beſides none that I know haue written in our Language ſo largely of this argument, and ſuch is the extent and ſpiritualneſſe of this heauenly point, that many men &amp; of the greateſt graces &amp; parts may with great benefit to the Church, diue and digge ſtill into this myſterie. Neither let any except againſt the multitude of quotations of Scriptures, they are brought vnder their proper head, and ſet in their proper place, and the matter it ſelfe is cut out into varietie of parts. Store (as wee vſe to ſpeake) is no ſore, we count it a delight to take out of a full heape, the more light, the conuiction is the ſtronger, what ſutes not at one time will ſute our ſpirits and occaſions at another, and what taketh not with one, may take with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But the full and well handling of matters in this Treatiſe carries ſuch ſatisfaction with it, that it frees mee from neceſſitie of further diſcourſe, and mine owne preſent weakneſſe of bodie taketh mee off. Only I was willing to yeeld that teſtimonie to the fruitfull paines of a faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:944:4"/> labourer in Gods Vineyard, that I iudge it deſeruedly. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it therefore, Chriſtian Reader, with thankes to God that ſtirreth vp ſuch helpers of that faith by which wee liue, ſtand, conquer, and in which we muſt die, if we looke to receiue the end of our faith, the ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>

It is of grace that man might belieue, and ſo might he that continueth in infidelitie, for hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued equall aide, and was equally perſwaded and incited by the Spirit. But if the queſtion bee, why doth the one

The power to belieue, and will to vſe that power, is of God: But the act of the will in reſting vpon Chriſt is mans.

For when the word of life is ſtedfaſtly, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, certainly aſſented vnto, and ſincerely embraced, no temptation or aſſault can make a man flinch, ſhuffle, or ſtart aſide from the conſtant proſecution of ſaluation in the way of life, and the faithfull practice of ſuch duties as God preſcribes for the attaining of that end. Faith that is ſincere in qualitie, is euer ſound in degree, being of ſtrength to make reſiſtance againſt all oppoſition that ſhall encounter it, hauing taken the heart for it Fort and defenced Tower. Againe, faith being once ſet in the Heart as in it throne and ſeate of Maieſtie, doth euery day confirme and ſtrengthen it ſelfe more and more, whereby the belieuer growes more reſolute to withſtand all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and temptations ſhot againſt him. The faith that takes kindly, ſpreads it ſelfe by aſſent and cloſe adherence to euery obiect within the ſpheare of diuine Truth, to which it cleaueth inuincibly, and from which it cannot be ſeperated by any aduerſe power, or carnall allurement, naturall paſſion or fierie aſſault.

But Charitie cannot ſerue for that vſe: becauſe I cannot preſume of that that is anothers, vpon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of my loue towards him, but vpon confidence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his loue towards me. Be it that all things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt friends, before we can build the cupon, we muſt haue it reſolued vnto vs, that God takes vs for his friends, which can bee no otherwiſe but by faith only.

Faith and loue are different gifts and graces: and ſome effects are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to faith which agree not to charitie; as faith is ſaid to iuſtifie, to purifie the heart, to ouercome the world, to receiue the promiſes.

If charitie ſhould bee the forme of faith, then faith hath two different formes, its proper and the forme of loue; then faith ſhould be the only pure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of loue, then ſhould it be obedient to loue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of it, as the matter is obedient to the forme, and contained of it.

But charitie is obedient to faith, faith gouerneth charitie: for whatſoeuer wee loue vprightly, it muſt be knowne, by faith that wee ought to loue it, and our loue muſt be quickened by faith, to loue it vniformely, and in right order.

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14.</note> by which Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts, and wee receiue the promiſed ſpirit; into which as a hand, God putteth all the riches of his grace of our ſaluation, &amp; by which all acts of grace are quickened; wee feed vpon Chriſt for the ſtrengthening and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule, and whatſoeuer is in vs is commended vnto God. If we reſpect length of time and continuance, charitie is to be preferred before faith. For faith is but for a time, and when the promiſe of God, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubiect of it, ſhal be fully accompliſhed, the vſe of it ſhall ceaſe. When faith paſſeth into an open knowledge and reuealed ſight of the thing preſent, it changeth both his nature and kind. But loue abideth for euer, and ſhall continue betwixt God and vs an euerlaſting bond: it ſhall be greater and more vehement, but ſhall ſtill retaine the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:944:47"/> ſame nature and ſubſtance, albeit ſome workes which now it exerciſeth ſhall ceaſe. The end of our faith is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: but the foundation and director of loue is faith: faith alſo is the victorie whereby we ouercome the world. To ſaue a man faith is the greater: in Man being ſaued loue is the greater. Till faith haue finiſhed our ſaluation loue muſt yeeld to faith: when faith hath fully ſaued vs, it ſhall haue an end, for knowledge of ſight takes away faith, but loue ſhall abide for euer. Abſolutely loue is greater then faith, but when we ſpeake of the meanes of Iuſtification, and attainment of that ſaluation, whereto perfect charitie and righteouſnes doth belong, then faith muſt bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For he ſpeakes not of internall charitie, which lodgeth in the heart, but of externall workes, which are outwardly viſible and apparent vnto men, and cannot be the life, but are the fruites and effects of faith. For that which is without and externall, cannot bee the life or ſoule of that which is within and internall: nay it ſelfe hath from within all the life that it hath; and if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not life from within, it is altogether dead. Workes therefore being outward, and iſſuing from within, if they be true, can in no good conſtruction be ſaid to be the life of faith which is within, but to be the iſſues and productions of faith from which they ſpring. Beſides the word vſed by the Apoſtle doth ſignifie <hi>the breath,</hi> and and ſo the compariſon runneth plaine; As the body of a l uing creature, if it breathe not is dead: ſo faith, if it bring forth no workes, is dead: For breathing is an effect of a liuing body, and working is the proper effect of a liuing faith. If we ſpeake of faith as it is outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:944:48"/> to men, workes which may bee diſcerned by the eyes of men, not charitie which is the inward affection of the heart, are they that giue name and gaine credit to profeſſion. Charitie is an hand or inſtrument whereby faith worketh: workes are fruites, effects, demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the inward life of faith: and that which giues name and being to our externall proffeſſion, is a pure, blameleſſe, vpright conuerſation, fruitefull in good workes. If we ſpeake of faith, a dead faith may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a dead body, altogether void of ſpirituall quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but a liuely faith cannot fitly be reſembled to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing body, but rather to the life of the body: becauſe faith is not that which is quickened by charitie or the the workes of charitie, but that which quickeneth. Faith is the firſt wheele in the Clocke that moueth all the reſt: Faith ſtirreth vp and directeth all other graces of the ſoule in their operations, whoſe ſtrength increaſeth according to the liuely-hood, vigor, and increaſe of faith.<note place="margin">Iames <hi>2.22.</hi> Rhem. annot. in Loc.</note> How then ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>That faith is perfected by workes?</hi> As we iudge of the cauſe by the effects, and by the proportion of the effects the efficacie and force of the cauſe may ſeeme to be increaſed or diminiſhed, euery thing is acknowledged to bee perfect when it worketh, and is eſteemed ſo much the more perfect, by how much the more it worketh; as wee ſay the goodneſſe of a tree is perfect, when it hath brought forth ſome excellent good fruite. Thus Phyloſophers teach, that the forme is not perfect, when it is conſidered as the firſt act, but when it is taken as the ſecond act: for by working it putteth forth it force and declareth it ſelfe. And ſo faith is perfected by workes, not that the nature of faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth complement or perfection from workes, but becauſe it doth declare and manifeſt it ſelfe by loue and good workes, and is eſteemed by ſo much the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the workes produced are the more excellent. Yea, as the exerciſe of outward members increaſeth internall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:944:48"/> vigor and ſtrength, and refreſheth the ſpirits by which wee moue; ſo doth the exerciſe of grace and vertue rightly imployed perfect faith, not imparting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of workes vnto it, but ſtirring vp exerciſing and intending it owne vigor and perfection. Senſe and motion is the effect, not the cauſe of life in the body; but yet the body without them is dead, and perfected by them. Workes are the effects, not the life of faith, but faith without workes is dead, and by workes it is perfected.</p>

                  </note> then faith is true though ſeparated from loue.

Beſides, if it be ſome other, then by that grace of faith, whereby they reſted vpon the extraordinarie promiſe and power of God, they had neuer beene able to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt good and euill, or to behold the worth and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſtian loue and kindneſſe, though neuer ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted in their hearts. To this queſtion it is directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the exerciſe of loue was to bee raiſed in theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearts, by faith, for common offence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:944:50"/> and qualities the ſame with that whereby they wrought miracles; but by the ſame faith rightly ſet, deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, taking better in the heart diffuſing it vertue into the ſeuerall faculties, ſpreading it ſelfe vniformely vnto the particular branches of Chriſtian duties, directing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections vnto ſpirituall obiects, and fixing them faſteſt vpon ſuch as it adiudgeth beſt, and moſt effectuall to the edifying of themſelues and others. In luſtifying faith two things are to be conſidered: the common nature or ſubſtance, and the ſpecificall nature, plantation and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie. For faith hiſtoricall and Iuſtifying agree in this, that both the one and the other is an aſſent to diuine truths, grounded vpon the authoritie of the reuealer: Faith temporary and Iuſtifying agree in this, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word, and reſt vpon the mercies of God: but in radication, ſoueraigntie, and working, and ſo in ſpeciall nature, ſauing faith differeth from other kinds. The ſeed which fell by the high way ſide, in ſtonie ground, among thornes, and in good ſoile, was one and the ſame: and in moſt of theſe grounds it tooke, not alike in all, kindly in the good ſoyle alone. The common nature of faith is to receiue the Word, which ſome receiue by bare aſſent of vnderſtanding, others by ſleight and ſuperficiall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which vaniſheth away: but the doctrine of life ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth kindly in the honeſt and good heart, which embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it ſoundly with vnfained and wel-rooted affiance. Iuſtifying faith is diſcerned from the other kinds, not by this, that it receiueth the promiſes which they doe not: but it receiueth them in another manner and degree, with firmer radication in the heart, which is the ſeate of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that it might ſeaſon them, and ſubiect earthly deſires to the affectation of heauenly things.

How may it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that hee had faith? Forſooth, becauſe hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that Table, which are the Sacraments. Not to queſtion that expoſition for the preſent, was no man euer admitted to the Sacraments, that made ſhew of faith, when indeed he had none? Many hypocrites are in the Church, that haue not ſo much as a perſwaſion of the truth of the Scripture, and ſo abſolutely want their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage garment. And men are admitted to the Sacrament by men, and admitted for profeſſion of faith, when they that admit them cannot tell whether they haue faith or not. For many pretend that which is not in them, and with the mouth make profeſſion of faith, when their heart is barren and emptie of grace. Further this man might aſſent vnto truths diuine, and acknowledge them as true, but not from a ſound and ſincere ground: or hee
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:944:52"/> might aſſent vnto the Articles of Chriſtian Faith as true and good, whileſt conſidered only in themſelues, without oppoſition of ſuch matters as he much valued: and ſuch beliefe being vnſound, ſhallow, ſubordinate to earthly pleaſures or commodities, may bee and is ſeperated from loue, but it is not that faith wee ſpeake of. The generall meaning of the Parable ſeemes to bee no more but this, that many men thruſt into the Church, who, when the day of triall comes, will bee found to haue no intereſt to the Kingdome of Heauen. What if the wedding garment bee charitie? this doth hurt vs nothing, vnleſſe it could bee proued, (which can neuer be) that this man had Iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith.

For it appeareth that they had oyle in their lampes, and that their lampes were lighted, although by long tarrying of the Bridegroome, they were afterwards quenched. Our Aduerſaries teach, that theſe Virgins had aſpired to more then ordinary perfection in the Church: and had they gotten this without good workes? It is a ſtrange perfection that can bee attained without all good deedes ſpirituall or corporall.

But the, Deuill againſt his will, belieues all that God hath reuealed. This is but a poore euaſion, for if they will heare their brethren of <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rhem. annet in Math. <hi>15.</hi> Sect. <hi>1</hi>
                  </note> they tell them plainly, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doubted not to call a dead faith without workes, the faith not of Chriſtians, but of Deuils. The Apoſtle then doth not liken Chriſtian Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith to the faith of Deuils in ſome points only, but proues the dead faith profeſſed by ſome, not to bee true and ſauing faith indeed, becauſe the Deuils belieue in that manner. The firſt point, wherein the faith of Chriſtians and of Deuils is ſaid to agree, comprehendeth the fulneſſe and perfection of that which they call Catholike or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:944:54"/> Faith, which conſiſteth in belieuing all to bee true, that God hath reuealed. No more is there in <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, if we conſider the act of faith, and no leſſe in the Deuill, and the ſame in euery Catholike Chriſtian, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their doctrine. That which is added to ſhew the difference betwixt the faith of Chriſtians and the faith of Deuils is little to the purpoſe. For it is not taken from the nature of faith it ſelfe, but from thoſe things which to faith are meerely accidentall. The godly and deuout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and willing ſubmiſſion to the rules of faith, which is in Chriſtians, being an act of charitie, and not of faith, differenceth not true faith in it ſelfe from the faith of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but diſtinguiſheth faith and charitie from faith only. And thus our Aduerſaries make the Deuill a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike againſt his will. Or if they will ſay, that true Chriſtian faith doth alwayes actually and neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this godly affection, and willing ſubmiſſion of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the rules of faith, then becauſe this cannot bee without charitie, let them ſay, as the truth is, that true Chriſtian faith cannot bee ſeparated from loue and good workes. It is impertinent to diſpute, whether the faith of Deuils be naturall, coact, and diſhoneſt, or the faith of wicked men ſupernaturall, voluntarie, and Honeſt, as if theſe things diſtinguiſhed the faith of vngodly men from the faith of Deuils. For if the maieſtie of Gods infallible truth command the aſſent of Deuils to that which they loue not, doth not the ſame cauſe alſo preuaile with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, who beare no affection to God or goodneſſe. And as for the honeſtie or diſhoneſtie of the act, there can no circumſtance bee named, why it ſhould bee honeſt in wicked men, and diſhoneſt in the Deuils: for it is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed in both. And if it be granted, that faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes or grace, is in men the gift of God, but the faith of Deuils not ſo: this argues a difference only in the cauſe, not in the eſſence, nature or qualitie. And though it bee his gift, yet being without grace and charitie, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:944:54"/> without theſe of neceſſitie as vnfruitfull as the faith of Deuils (both which our Aduerſaries grant) it is no more auaileable to make a Chriſtian, then the faith of Deuils is. It is further obiected, if faith cannot be without charitie, then faith alone doth not iuſtifie. This followeth not,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Iuſtiſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi> §.

Faith alone doth iuſtifie, that is priuatiuely conſidered without hope or charitie as cauſes concurring therewith in iuſtification: but this faith cannot really be ſeperated from, or negatiuely conſidered without hope and charitie. For though it be true, that the total cauſe of any thing being in act, the effect muſt needs follow, yet from the totall cauſe we cannot ſeparate thoſe things, together with which it hath in nature it exiſtence and beeing, and without which it cannot be in act for the producing of the effect, though they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erre nothing thereto: becauſe that is to denie the being of it, and to deſtroy the cauſe. The eye alone ſeeth, the eare alone hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: but it muſt be a liuing eye, and hearing eare, not ſeparated from the head or broken off from the reſt of the bodie. Faith alone iuſtifies without other graces, not in regard of their preſence, but in regard of their co-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with faith to this effect of our Iuſtification. It is one thing to ſay, the eye is in the head without other ſenſes, and another thing to ſay, the eye doth ſee alone, no other ſenſe ſeeing with it. Liuelihood is the qualification of that faith that iuſtifieth; and workes, at leaſt a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and promptitude of heart to good workes, is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith as immediate as Iuſtification. So then faith cannot bee withot loue, and yet wee apprehend not the promiſes, of eternall life by workes, but by faith alone, although truly they cannot be apprehended by parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of workes, at leaſt of ſincere reſolution to walke in obedience. Nor doth faith alone apprehend the truth or deriue the benefit of diuine promiſes to our ſelues, but by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:944:55"/> it alone, (though accompanied with all other ſanctifying graces, and attended with the whole traine of good workes) wee expect and pray the promiſes may be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not for our ſakes, or for any righteouſneſſe wee haue in vs, or can hope for in this Life, but only for the merit of Chriſt, by his ſole mediation and interceſſion. In briefe, the faith which iuſtifieth is operatiue, attended with good workes of all ſorts, accompanied with all graces of the the Spirit: but we liue by it as it vnites vs to the Lord of life; yea by it alone, not by it and other parts of grace, in as much as by it wee truſt in Gods mercies offered in Chriſt, wholly relying on them, not partly on them, and partly on our workes or righteouſneſſe.</p>

                  </note>It is againe obiected, that in the Creed is contained the whole obiect of Iuſtifying faith: But in it there is no mention of the ſpeciall mercie of God. In this obiection there is a two-fold miſtaking; for in the Creed is contained the obiect of faith which is belieued, that is, the ſumme of doctrine to be belieued to ſaluation is there explained: But here we ſpeake of the obiect of Iuſtifying faith, by which we belieue. The doctrine of faith is one thing, the priuate act of the heart relying vpon the promiſes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie another. Now when we enquire, what is the obiect of Iuſtifying faith, the queſtion is not what is the ſumme of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:944:65"/> faith, or of the articles to be belieued, but what the faith of the heart in all theſe articles which it belieueth, doth firſt and principally looke vnto, reſt vpon, and receiue to ſaluation.

An houſe well builded vpon a rocke is as ſure as the foundation: euery thing hanging on a pin or pegg is as ſure as the pin or pegg on which it hangeth: True faith firmely groundeth it ſelfe vpon the faithfull promiſes of God, and receiueth them as better then life it ſelfe, from which it will not bee with-drawne by any carnall allurements: and therefore in euent it cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrie, for the ground is firme and vnchangeable.

When a Chriſtian calleth to mind what ſtrength worldly allurements haue in him, how often hee yeildeth vnto aſſaults in many pettie temptations, how weake and fraile, dull and negligent hee is in the duties of Chriſtianitie and his particular calling: the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe things will, no queſtion, trouble the eye of faith. Not that the comfort of a Chriſtian is grounded vpon his ſtrength of grace or any good worke that is or can be done by him: but becauſe his beliefe in the mercie of God cannot be greater then his ſtrength to ouercome worldly allurements, wherby hee might be withdrawne from God, or care to yeeld vniforme, ſincere and conſtant obedience to all Gods Commandements. Againe, it is one thing to haue a thing ſurely, another thing to know I haue it ſurely. We ſeeke many things that we haue in our hands: we haue many things that we thinke we haue loſt: ſo a Belieuer, who hath a ſure beliefe, yet doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes know that he ſo belieueth, ſeeketh but findeth it not; nay, thinketh he is altogether without faith, when he hath it vnfainedly.

What? that our ſinnes are pardoned: No: but when we belieue in Chriſt to obtaine pardon; which is the thing promiſed vpon condition of beliefe. Aſſurance that our ſinnes bee pardoned is concluded in a practicall Syllogiſme thus; He that truly belieueth in Chriſt hath obtained pardon of his ſinnes: But I belieue: Therefore my ſinnes are pardoned:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:944:70"/> where aſſurance of the pardon of ſinne is a concluſion drawne from a two-fold ground, the one expreſſed in Scripture, the other euident (if true) by the teſtimonie of the renewed conſcience, and preſuppoſeth that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth, and is aſſured that he doth belieue. Now if aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of remiſſion be concluded from this ground, that he belieueth, and knoweth certainly that hee belieueth, then the beliefe which is required on our parts to Iuſtification cannot be an aſſurance that our ſins be waſhed away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. For if we take the word belieue for a perſwaſion that our ſinnes are done away, then the Syllogiſme run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus; He that is aſſured of the pardon of his ſinnes, his ſinnes are pardoned. But I am aſſured of the pardon of my ſinnes: therefore my ſinnes are pardoned. Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the pardon of ſinne, as it is profered in the word of grace, and groundeth it ſelfe ſolely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vpon the promiſe of God in Ieſus Chriſt: But the ground, whereupon a ſinner in himſelfe guiltie ſhould build aſſurance that his ſinnes are pardoned, without ſome other act of faith comming betwixt the promiſe &amp; that aſſurance, there is none. The Goſpell offereth pardon to the thirſtie and burdened, if hee will receiue it: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them of pardon, who haue embraced the promiſe: but where ſhall wee finde ground, whereupon the guiltie perſon who belieueth not to remiſſion of ſinnes may bee aſſured, that his ſinnes not actually pardoned, are yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and blotted out of Gods remembrance? Faith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the pardon preſented to it in the word of promiſe, and trauailing with it, bringeth forth actuall remiſſion of ſinne, which vpon our faith we receiue.

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1, 2.</note> then that <hi>Dauid</hi> begs pardon both of the guilt and puniſhment of his offences, and that God would make him ſee and feele this forgiueneſſe of his eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more and more. Neither yet doth it follow, that then prayer for forgiueneſſe is an effect of a weake faith;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:944:78"/> becauſe though our faith were ſtrong, yet the feeling of our owne wretchedneſſe, the iuſt deſert of ſinne, and the wrath of God due vnto vs, would wring out ſuch entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from vs: as wee ſee the extremitie which our Sauiour Chriſt was in vpon the Croſſe made him cry out ſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi>

Againe, one chiefe reaſon and end of our praying to God for pardon is, that wee may alwayes acknowledge, that euery ſinne committed by vs deſerues euerlaſting damnation of it ſelfe, and ſhould euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be puniſhed, if that God had not accepted our Sauiour Chriſts ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs: By which though we are freed if we reſt on him by faith, yet both it is our duty according to Gods Commandement to ſue for pardon for his ſake; &amp; in truth if we do it not, we haue no reaſon to perſwade our ſelues that our ſinnes are pardoned. For howſoeuer it is true, that Chriſt our Head hath paid the price of our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, yet it is alſo true, that wee euery day deſerue dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and muſt entreate God for pardon, that ſo wee may come to that aſſurance, which the Lord hath enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs to labour and ſeeke for.<note place="margin">

What followeth hereupon? Euen theſe two things, which directly ouerthrowe the doctrine of our Aduerſaries: viz, That hee who hath receiued grace from God, may know the truth, though not the meaſure of his faith and repentance: And Ignorance of the exact multitude and greatnes of our offences is no barre or hinderance to the certaintie of ſaluation. <hi>Who knowes the multitude of his ſinnes?</hi>

And ſo he that is iuſtified and hath obtained remiſſion of ſinnes, may aſſuredly know or belieue that hee hath receiued mercie of the Lord: otherwiſe he can neuer truly bee thankefull to God for that ineſtimable benefit.

But he that admits this anſwere for ſound and Catholike, and yet den es the Churches propoſall to bee the true and proper cauſe of his beliefe in the former point, hath ſmothered the light of nature, by admitting too artificiall ſubtiltie into his braines. Whatſoeuer it be, Cauſe, Condition, Circumſtance or effect, that truly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth this demand, Why doe you belieue this or that? it is a true &amp; proper cauſe of our beliefe though not of the thing belieued.

But in the ſecond acceptation (as wee alwayes take thoſe tearmes, when we reſolue our owne perſwaſions) that is, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all doubts or demands concerning the ſubiect whereof we treate: A Romane Catholiques faith, muſt according to his Principles, finally bee reſolued into the Churches or Popes inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It will not helpe them, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ouer the matter, and ſay, God reuealing diuine truth is the formall obiect of faith: For ſeeing God worketh mediately, and reuealeth no truth vnto vs but by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meanes: and diuine authoritie in it ſelfe is hidden and vnknowne: therefore the thing whereinto our faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, muſt be ſomething externally knowne, which we may reade or heare. And our Aduerſaries muſt lead vs to ſecret reuelation, which in words they pretend ſo much to defie, or yeeld vs an externall foundation and formall obiect of faith: And reiecting the Scriptures, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they gloſe in wordes, they neither can, nor doe name vs any other indeed, but the <hi>Romane</hi> Pope and Church. Nor will it boote them ought to ſay, that Gods Word in the Churches mouth is the rule of faith, whereinto it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolued, ſeeing the Church defines nothing but by Gods written or vnwritten. For this is more then the partie which belieues it can know, nor hath he any other motiue to belieue it, beſides the Churches definition or aſſertion. Suppoſe then wee ſhould conceiue ſo well of a temporall Iudge, as to preſume hee did neuer ſpeake but according to the true meaning either of ſtatute or cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie law: yet if wee could not know either the one or the other, or their right interpretation, but only by his determinations; the law were little beholden to him (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for a floute) that ſhould ſay, he were reſolued ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Iudge and it. For ſeeing the Law is to him alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vncertaine, but by the Iudges auouchment or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, his laſt reſolution of any act of Iuſtice, muſt be only into the Iudges skill and fidelitie. It is true indeed, that the Churches authoritie is not comprehended in the obiect of beliefe, whileſt it only propoſeth other Articles
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:944:91"/> to be belieued. No more is the Sunne comprehended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obiect of our actuall ſight, whileſt we behold co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or other viſible things by the vertue of it. But yet, as it could not make colours or other things become more viſible vnto vs, vnleſſe it ſelfe were the firſt viſible, that is, vnleſſe it might bee ſeene more clearly then thoſe things which we ſee by it, ſo we would direct our ſight vnto it) ſo would it be impoſſible, the Churches infallible propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall ſhould be the reaſon of a <hi>Romane</hi> Catholikes beliefe of Scriptures, or their orthodoxall ſence, vnleſſe it were the firſt and principall credible, or primarie obiect of his beliefe, or that which muſt bee moſt clearely, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and moſt ſtedfaſtly belieued, ſo as all other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles beſides, muſt be belieued by the beliefe of it.

Theſe be the ſound, comfortable, enduring fruits of faith, in which reſpect who can but ſay, that faith is an excellent grace? a rich iewell, a pearle of price, the Chriſtian mans treaſure? Faith is a principall thing, the merchandiſe thereof is better then ſiluer, and the fruites thereof then fine gold. Without faith there is no plentie to man on earth: with faith there can bee no want of any thing that is good. For how can hee lacke any good thing, who hath God for his Father, Chriſt his Sauiour, the holy Ghoſt his ſealer and Comforter, the Angels to guard him, Heauen his inheritance: who hath Gods faithfull promiſe confirmed by oath and ſeale, to ſecure him of all things needfull, grace, comfort and earthly bleſſings, and is kept by the power of God vnto ſaluation? But here it muſt be obſerued, that faith doth not effect and performe theſe things, by any excellencie, force, or efficacie of it owne aboue other graces but in reſpect of the office wherunto it is aſſigned in the Couenant of grace. It is a cauſe onely Inſtrumentall, and that is atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto it, which the principall cauſe worketh. Faith iuſtifies not as an act or qualitie, but as it receiueth Chriſt: faith purifieth not the heart of it ſelfe, but as it is the inſtrument whereby the Spirit worketh. Whatſoeuer wee are made by faith, wee are made it in Chriſt and whatſoeuer faith makes to bee ours, it is alſo in Chriſt. Therefore faith maketh not God to be our God, but in Chriſt: nor vs the children of God, but in Chriſt. And whatſoeuer grace is wrought in the heart of any man, it is the gift of God, the worke of the holy Ghoſt: but faith is the Inſtrument whereby the Spirit doth more renue and purifie our hearts.</p>

Whereunto ſeuerall anſwers are made, Firſt, that one and the ſame thing in diuers reſpects may be referred to diuers ſubiects, as theſe ſubiects are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſeperated, but conioyned amongſt themſelues. So friend-ſhip is one morall vertue, and yet in the Minde and will both.

                  </note> attributing a double certaintie vnto it, one in reſpect of the vnderſtanding, another in reſpect of the will.

Secondly it is anſwered, that ſauing faith doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe knowledge and aſſent as the roote and foundation: but formally it is an affection, towards the promiſe of grace, and ſeated in the heart. As the reaſonable ſoule doth giue life, ſence and motion as inferior operations: ſo iuſtifying faith doth knowe and aſſent, but as iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth truſt and relie vpon the mercie of God in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Thirdly, Iuſtifying faith, or faith as it iuſtifyeth, is not one vertue, not any vertue but iuſtifyeth onely as it makes vs partakers of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt; which it doth not by any digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or excellencie of it owne, but in reſpect of the place and office which our mercifull God hath freely and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted vnto it. Now nothing hindreth why God ſhould not giue the name of faith both to aſſent in the

But for the remedie thereof let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to fortifie faith in the gracious promiſes which God hath made to his children of ſuſtentation &amp; perſeruation. As faith increaſeth, ſo feare abateth; as it ebs ſo feare flows. And let them to this end conſider, that Chriſt hath prayed for preſeruation againſt all ſeperating extreames. And God that cannot lie, hath promiſed to keepe his children from vtter declining, and to eſtabliſh them that be feeble and readie to fall. The Lord hath made it knowne to be his will and pleaſure, that hee will neuer take away that grace which once he hath giuen, but increaſe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till it be perfected and accompliſhed: and when we

Feare is a deceitfull and malitious paſſion, tyrannicall, raſh and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, proceeding oftentimes from want of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more then from the preſence or approach of euill to be feared, tormenting with the dread of what ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come, we were neuer in danger of: It is therefore valiantly to be reſiſted, not to bee belieued or reaſoned withall. Feare in our owne ſtrength is by all meanes to bee cheriſhed: but diffidence in Gods power, mercie, goodneſſe, truth and prouidence is to bee abandoned. The ſtrong muſt not preſume in himſelfe, though more excellent then others in grace, nor the weake diſtruſt in the Lord, though feeble, and not able to goe high-lone. The hope of preſeruation ſtaying vpon inherent grace is ſelfe confidence: and the feare of falling ariſing from the ſence of weakenes is diffidence in God. In holy Scripture we ſhall finde, that the ſtrongeſt haue fallen, when the weake haue ſtood and they haue beene foiled moſt grieuouſly, not in the greateſt aſſaults, but when they haue giuen way to their luſts, neglected their watch, or were growen ſecure and dreaded no danger.

For they were ſubiect to innumerables infirmities, which are not ſpecified in the Booke of God; neither was it fit that it ſhould bee a regiſter of their manifold temptations, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and fals.

So that a Chriſtian may not account himſelfe void of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not perfect in faith, knowledge and loue: but he is wiſely to conſider the ſecret worke of Gods Spirit and grace, and take comfort of the ſmalleſt crumme and drop of this heauenly ſuſtentation, and attend the time of perfect growth according to the good pleaſure of God. Oh, but they feele not the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, which might aſſure them; they can finde no ſparke of grace in themſelues. Neither doe any of Gods children at all times feele it: but that they may ſee their own frailty, God doth as it were hide himſelfe for a ſeaſon (as a Mother doth from her childe to trie his affection) that they may with more earneſt deſire mourne for Gods wounted grace, and praiſe him with more ioyfulneſſe of heart when they haue obtained it againe. And yet God doth not with-hold comfort from his children, many times when they walke heauenly: but their owne frailty and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of temptation which oppreſſeth them, diminiſheth the feeling thereof. When the winde is lowde, the aire ſtormie and tempeſtuous, a man cannot heare the voice of his friend when the heart is filled with feares, and perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed with manifold temptations toſſing it vp and downe,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:944:123"/> the calme and ſtill voice of the Spirit is not diſcerned. And in thoſe ſeaſons, the triall of faith is to be taken by thoſe fruits which are euident to the eye of others, who can iudge more ſincerely then the afflicted themſelues in that anguiſh of ſoule and ſpirit. As the ſicke man during the time of his diſtemper, muſt not truſt to his owne taſte, but rather relie vpon the learned Phyſicion, and other honeſt and diſcreet friends: ſo the faithfull muſt not giue too much credit to the ſuggeſtions of their owne heart poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with feare, but rather belieue their faithfull Paſtor, and other godly and experienced Chriſtians that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.

He who hath ſpoken this to mee, Hold me, and I will ſet thee free, I will circumciſe thy heart, waſh it, purge it, heale it of all ſickneſſes and infirmities: he that hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, is God Almightie, who giueth Being to all viſible creatures, and that inuiſible world of Spirits: who calleth the things that are not, as if they were: who if there were no print of theſe things in me, can worke and create them gloriouſly, as at firſt he drew this excellent frame of the world out of that confuſed lumpe, or Maſſe which hee made of nothing.

Loe, he calleth the thirſtie, who bee deſtitute of all ſap and fruit of grace, to come vnto him, that they may be refreſhed. The Saints, who haue beene moſt enriched with varietie of graces, were by nature as poore and deſtitute as thou art. What they had, they receiued by faith: Belieue as they did, and ſpeed with them. Why crieſt thou out diſtruſtfully by reaſon of thy barrenneſſe? Doth the ſtreaming fountaine denie water to the thirſtie traueller?

If the worth of things may be meaſured by their price, well then may the Sonſhip of true Belieuers be valued at the higheſt rate. Who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admire the dignitie of this eſtate (to be the Sonne of God) which could not bee procured ſaue only by this infinite price, the making of him become nothing, by whom God in the beginning made euery thing? It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a matter of great honour to be the ſeruant of the Prince in ſome ſpeciall place of eminencie in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: How doe men ſeeke and ſue for ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices? how do they reioyce when their deſires are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed?

It is better and more honourable
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:944:162"/> to be the ſeruant of God, then the Commander of men; to be an heire apparant to Heauen, then the poſſeſſor of the whole World. There is a great opinion, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt cauſe, of the eſtate of our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> whileſt they were in Paradiſe, before their fall.

To bee made the Sonnes of God by Adoption, of meere, rich, and vndeſerued loue in Chriſt. And is it not an admirable prerogatiue, to bee brought by Chriſt into a more excellent ſtate, then that which <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie and glorie had iuſt cauſe to wonder at. The low degree from which we are raiſed, doth commend this, and as the gratiouſneſſe of him who preferreth, ſo the excellencie of that ſtate whereunto the Belieuer is exalted. Of the ſeruants of ſinne, to be made the Sonnes of God; of the vaſſals of Satan, to bee taken to raigne with Chriſt in glory for euermore; of children of wrath, dead in treſpaſſes, to be begotten againe to the hope of an inheritance, immortall, vndefiled, that fadeth not; what an vnſpeakable fauour is this? O my ſoule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, ſtirre vp thy ſelfe ſtedfaſtly to receiue the promiſe of life; and hold it faſt: for Gods promiſes are certaine, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leſſe, but rather more in accompliſhment then in tender.

True faith is a neuer fading faith, the life of grace an euerlaſting life, the water of life, a well ſpringing vnto eternall life. Chriſt once died for ſinne, neuer to die any more: and he that liueth in Chriſt ſhall liue for euer. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if faith were the worke of freewill or had depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon it, it might well periſh, but being the intire gift of God according to his purpoſe of grace, it muſt needs pertake of the vnchangeable loue of God, which is the fountaine whence it ſpringeth.

For deſpaire, dumpiſhneſſe, foregoing the meanes of grace, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our calling, theſe are the things which Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to driue vs vnto: we doe him the greateſt pleaſure that may be, when we yeeld vnto him therein. Exceſſiue feare brings that vpon vs, from which eſpecially we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be freed, and ties vp the powers of the ſoule, that it can make no reſiſtance. Cowardiſe and fainting ſorrow put courage into our Aduerſarie: valour, reſolution, and confidence forceth him to giue backe. When wee giue place to doubting, deiectedneſſe, inordinate tyrannicall feares, wee put our ſelues into the hands of our Enemie: but the victory is ours, when by faith in the power and mercy of the Lord, we raiſe vp our hearts in courage, and buckle our ſelues to the duties that lie before vs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to abilitie granted of God. When wee are idle and ſolitarie, Satan hath moſt aduantage to moleſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, as the thiefe hath to ſteale, when the doore ſtands wide open: but conſcionable imployment ſhutteth the doore againſt him, and takes away opportunitie. This is the voice of faith, though Satan furiouſly aſſaile thee, be not diſmayed: when his temptations bee moſt fierce, bee thou moſt diligent in the meanes of grace, the practice of holineſſe, the labours of an honeſt calling; pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Satan indeuours by horrible, and fearefull inie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to driue the poore ſoule to deſpaire. Faith hearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him the more to belieue, and keepe cloſe vnder the ſhadow of the Lords wings. For the Deuill is let looſe, to chaſe vs neerer home, that we might ſticke faſter vnto the Lord, as the childe affrighted will cling vnto the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Satan deſires by carnall allurements and outward obiects to draw him from God, which he inforceth with all ſubtiltie: Faith oppoſeth ſtronger perſwaſions to wel-doing; it ſetteth before him the terrours of death eternall if he reuolt; the comforts of grace, and the ioyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if wee continue conſtant: in compariſon whereof all carnall inticements be of no moment. When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cannot preuaile by flatteries, hee ſeekes by force and violence to ouerthrow the poore ſeruants of Chriſt. Faith buildeth it ſelfe vpon Chriſt the euerlaſting rocke, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in his name, and getteth the victory.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, Faith is vigilant and watchfull at all times, in all places, vpon all occaſions againſt all ſins, with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof, ſpecially againſt ſins of conſtitution, calling, the time, company, corrupt education, the firſt riſe of ſinne-delighting motions, and ſinnes of ſolitarineſſe, that

Faith may ſlumber and take a nap for a little ſeaſon, when it is ill at eaſe: but the propertie of faith, when liuely and in good plight, is to keepe waking. For nothing is more wiſely fearefull then faith, nor more cautelous and circumſpect then holy feare: Nothing more carefull and ſuſpitious then faith: more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and induſtrious then holy care and ſuſpition. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more couetous and couragious then faith, more watchfull then couetouſneſſe and courage.

Feare, care, ſuſpition, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, courage any one of theſe, is ſufficient to keepe waking in earthly things: and when all of them ioyntly concurre, ſhall they not haue this effect in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall?

                  <note place="margin">Why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſometimes want the ſight of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>Tenthly, The faithfull are the Lords veſſels, which he vſeth to ſcoure by temptations. True it is, that in the time of triall, the graces of the Spirit doe not ſo much appeare to the notice of the belieuing heart: but by the ouer-ruling prouidence of God, they ſerue for the increaſe of grace, as the truth teacheth, faith belieueth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can teſtifie. Thus faith miniſtreth comfort in the moſt bitter agonies, if it bee rightly vſed, and ſtirred vp. But what if the child of God be brought ſo low, that he can diſcerne no ſparke of faith, no fruit of grace, no marke of Gods loue in himſelfe? It is not to be doubted, but the ſeruants of Chriſt through their weaknes, are oft brought by extremity of temptation into wofull deſolation, which yet the Lord doth wiſely order for the glory of his Name, and the good of his deiected ſeruants. And as in other things, ſo in this, that they cannot diſcerne any fruit of the Spirit, wherewith through the mercy of God, they are comfortably repleniſhed. For the bluſtering Tempeſts which the enemy raiſeth againſt them, cauſe ſuch diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the ſoule, and fill the heart with ſuch confuſion, feare and terrour, that for the preſent they are altogether vnable to iudge of their owne eſtate. For when the Mind is ouer-clouded with the miſts of Temptation, as the eye with the riſing of duſt; and the heart toſſed too and fro with vnquietneſſe, as the waues of the Sea when the winds are boiſterous; conſcience by recoiling vpon the ſoule cannot conceiue, or giue right notice of it true ſtate and temper. Troubled water will not giue backe the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the countenance: nor an afflicted Spirit the true diſpoſition of the inner man. When the poore Chriſtian makes ſearch into himſelfe, the temptation firſt puts forth it ſelfe, wherewith the heart is daunted, and thereupon concludeth, that no grace doth lodge or abide in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at firſt ſight it doth not appeare. Vnto theſe may be added, that good men are ſometimes pertiſhly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:944:180"/> to caſt away all they haue as nothing, becauſe they haue not what they deſire, or imagine others to enioy: herein reſembling little children, who for want of ſome ſmall trifle that they deſire, or ſome of their fellowes haue, throw away many things much more pretious.</p>
               <p>But not to inquire further into the cauſes of this miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note place="margin">The Remedie of this.</note> the remedy is;</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, hee muſt know, that as in ſicke perſons we ſee it commeth to paſſe, they thinke there is no hope of life, when the Phyſician and ſtanders by ſee certaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted tokens of health: So it is oftentimes in theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſickneſſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the wiſdome of a Chriſtian in this caſe to obſerue the marke that Satan driues at, which is to hide from his ſight the graces of the Spirit, that he might bring him to deſpaire. This being the Deuils aime, hee muſt ſtirre vp himſelfe to belieue, and roll his ſoule vpon Chriſt for ſaluation. For when he can ſee no grace in his ſoule, he cannot but ſee himſelfe to be miſerable, and ſo called to come vnto Chriſt the fountaine of liuing waters, that by him hee might be repleniſhed, in him hee might find refreſhing. Againe, taking courage to belieue, hee diſappoints Satan, who intendeth not ſo much to draw him into ſecurity, as to force him to caſt away all hope of mercie. Oh, but a Chriſtian is to examine and try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether hee be inriched with the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or no? True it is, that the examination of our hearts is a neceſſary duty, but to be done in due order, ſo as we be ſtirred vnto, not driuen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the practice of other duties no leſſe needfull: But when the ſoule is diſtempered with the aſſaults of Satan, and vnable to iudge of it owne ſtate, it is vnſeaſonable to make ſearch into our hearts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous is to giue place to doubtings, becauſe wee cannot find what wee deſire. Wee haue a commandement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, as well as to proue our ſelues, both which muſt bee coupled together, otherwiſe neither can be done as they
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:944:181"/> ought: and it is a plaine caſe, that he who finds himſelfe to be poore and naked, is called to come vnto Chriſt, that hee might receiue of his fulneſſe, bee inriched with his plentie. If thou canſt not find in thy ſelfe what thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt after, come vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and belieue in him, that thou mayeſt receiue what thou ſeekeſt, and is to bee found in him.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The diſtreſſed ſoule muſt learne, that the grace of God worketh not alwayes alike in his children.

Yea; many times the fruits of grace may ſhine in the conuerſation to the eyes of others, when the powers and ſtirrings of grace inwardly, being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with temptations, cannot be felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The long and manifold temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, wherewith hee ſeekes to throw Chriſtians head-long into deſpaire, is to them a teſtimonie of the inhabitation of the Spirit in their hearts. For the power and ſtrength whereby thoſe aſſaults are repelled,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 12.43, 44 <hi>Luke</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.</note> is it not of God? The vncleane ſpirit might eaſily enter into the houſe with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen other ſpirits worſe then himſelfe, and dwell there, if he found it ſwept and garniſhed, that is, empty and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of grace. The ſtrong man armed might well breake into the houſe, if a ſtronger then hee did not keepe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As the children of God are conquerours ouer many temptations, ſo one only temptation (and that of no long continuance) is able to ſinke the ſtouteſt among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, who are meere droſſe and refuſe, into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit of Hell. The ſtrong aſſaults whereby the Deuill laboureth the ouer-throw of the poore ſeruant of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:944:181"/> God, is to him an argument of ſtrength receiued, or that God will ſtrengthen him. For if he looke vnto God in the tentation, he calleth not forth his ſeruants to the conflict, vntill they be furniſhed, nor will he let Satan looſe vntill he haue inabled them to make reſiſtance. He will not lay waight vpon greene Timber: nor cruſh the tender youngling with burdens vnſupportable: whom God doth imploy in his warre either hee hath, or will make them able for the ſeruice. If he haue an eye, vnto Satans malice, why doth he muſter all his forces to beſiege, if there bee no ſtrength to withſtand?

That act cannot pleaſe God; which is not animated by faith: for it is but the naked carkeſe of a good worke, without life or ſoule, if that be wanting. It is faith, which impelleth to worke righteouſneſſe, and putteth life and

And when a Chriſtian knowes not, whether he ſhall haue ſtrength to doe what God requireth; nor whether God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him any promiſe, that his burden ſhall be made light and that Chriſt will beare the greateſt part of it for him, it muſt needs bee very tedious and troubleſome; it will occaſion many feares and doubts, deadneſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chearefulneſſe. This killeth the heart of right good Chriſtians, when they are ignorant, or not throughly informed, that God will make them able and fit for ſo great a worke, as the leading of a godly life. But if they haue this faith as a foundation to vphold them, they ſhall ſooner wade through their doubts, and grow out of their feares, as knowing that God will be euer with them for their aſſiſtance. Who doth not know, that when ſome certaintie of ſaluation is obtained, yet for all that in aſmuch as it is but weake, they haue many heart-griefes for this, that they ſee they haue a weariſome pilgrimage to goe thorow, and little knowledge and perſwaſion of any great guiding of them through all the feares and difficulties of it? A Chriſtian that hath this confidence, that God will ſtrengthen him to euery good worke, he ſhall goe about it with heart and cherefulneſſe; he ſhall be encouraged to pray as his neceſſitie ſhall giue cauſe, he ſhall be kept from fainting and diſmaidnes, when his ſtrength is not very great, and riſe vp againe when he is fallen. But if he be not wel grounded in belieuing, that God will build him vp more ſtrongly from day to day; &amp; perfect the good worke in him which is begunne, hee ſhall very much ſtagger and goe backe.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, By faith the belieuing parents muſt giue themſelues vnto God, chuſing him to bee their portion, and reſigning themſelues in all things to be guided by his word, in all eſtates and conditions.

A worldly Father would much reioyce, if his childe ſhould bee preferred to ſome chiefe Office in the Princes Court, aſſoone as it was borne: A Chriſtian Father hath much greater cauſe of ioy, that he is admitted, not as a ſeruant, but as a ſonne and heire, into the Court of the great King of Heauen and Earth.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, When wee ſee by faith from what miſeries wee are deliuered of the free grace and mercie of God, our hearts are enlarged in prayſe and thankſgiuing. In diſtreſſe faith powreth out ſupplications; when the calamitie is ouer-paſt it ſetteth forth the goodneſſe of the Lord, and ſingeth of his glorie. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in ſafetie on the ſhoare, looking backe vpon the danger eſcaped,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:944:244"/> when they paſſed through the red Sea,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 2.</note> they make a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noiſe to the God of their ſaluation: their ſongs are anſwerable to their fore-conceiued feare. And ſo when the Lord brought backe the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2.</note> their mouthes were filled with laughter, and their tongues with ioy. The due conſideration of our deſerts, manifeſt by the threatnings contained in the Word of God, doth maruellouſly affect the heart with deſire to publiſh and ſpread abroad the louing kindneſſe of the Lord, when by faith in Chriſt wee ſee our ſelues to bee ſet free from the dreadfull curſes of the Law, and mercifully ſaued from the righteous iudgement of our ſinnes. By this which hath beene ſaid, it is manifeſt, that this life of faith is moſt excellent and comfortable, and by good proofe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience wee ſhould be able to ſay ſo, if wee would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but to take a taſte of the benefit and ſweetneſſe that it bringeth. For by this faith we are directed to ſeeke and follow after Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</note> till wee come to be aſſured, that he dwelleth in vs as the fountaine of life, and that in him we are deliuered from the gilt and puniſhment of all our ſinnes:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</note> whereas others, who liue not by it, wauer, are oft diſtracted, and know not where to begin the foundation of that great worke, nor how to build thereon. By this faith we may come to ſound reſt and holy ſecuritie about our ſaluation from time to time, enioying the comfort of it ſtill more and more with incredible ioy: whereas others, euen the beſt, are oft vnſetled and much diſquieted. If the Lord lead vs into the darke, and exerciſe vs with manifold afflictions and temptations, by this faith we are enabled to hold him by the hand, to caſt our ſelues vpon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of grace, and ſo relying vpon his power, faithfulneſſe and mercy, to promiſe ſafetie vnto our ſelues aboue likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and appearance; yea, when wee feele the contrarie. The rage of ſinne is weakened, and wee haue ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, though not alwayes to preuaile (which were not expedient) yet at leaſt to be in combate with it, which is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:944:244"/> euer a good teſtimonie of our ſafetie: for hereby we proue our ſelues to bee liuely members of the Church Militant. Alſo by this we are preſerued againſt fearefull ſinnes, and haue grace to walke in newneſſe of life, and all parts of it with ioy and chearefulneſſe. If we liue by faith we haue deliuerance from m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
